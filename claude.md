# Varsany Print Automation — Project Knowledge Base

> Business: Varsany / Fullymerched — Amazon custom print-on-demand
> Last updated: 2026-07-16 (verified against live code — see section 21 for what changed)

---

## 1. Business Overview

**Company:** Varsany (sold on Amazon UK as CrystalsRus)
**Store:** amazon.co.uk/stores/Varsany
**Business model:** Customer customises garment on Amazon → order placed →
design team creates print file → printing department prints and ships

**Products sold:**
- Hoodies, sweatshirts, zip sweatshirts
- T-shirts (adult, kids, polo)
- Baby vests, slippers, swimsuits, legsuits
- Gymnastics towel ponchos, tote bags, track pants, leggings
- Bags (tote, backpack, makeup, shoe, string, knitting), golf towels/cases,
  memorial plaques, cushions, beanies, bucket hats, socks, seatbelt covers

**Print type:** DTF (Direct to Film) — all products personalised per order.
Some orders are rhinestone/embroidery instead of DTF — these are detected
and routed to manual processing (see section 10).

---

## 2. Current Manual Process (Before Automation)

1. Customer places order on Amazon with customisation (image, text, font, colour)
2. Order data saved to cloud database (Azure/AWS SQL Server)
3. Designer opens order page at `crssoft.co.uk/Order/CustomOrder`
4. Designer manually upscales image in Topaz Labs website
5. Designer opens Photoshop, creates canvas for correct product/zone
6. Designer types customer text, applies font and colour manually
7. Designer positions elements matching the Amazon preview image
8. Designer saves as [OrderID].psd to Synology Drive
9. File syncs from India to UK via Synology + SpeedFusion/Peplink router
10. Printing department opens PSD, flattens, and prints

**Time per order:** 10-15 minutes manually
**Target with automation:** 30-60 seconds automatically (actual current rate:
~5-7 minutes/order on this VM — see section 19 for why, and section 21 for
the fixes applied so far)

---

## 3. Database Structure

**Database name:** dbAmazonCustomOrders
**Type:** Microsoft SQL Server
**Hosted:** Azure / AWS cloud server
**Local backup:** .bak file restored to localhost\SQLEXPRESS for testing
**Connection (local):**
```
Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS; Database=dbAmazonCustomOrders;
Trusted_Connection=yes; TrustServerCertificate=yes;
```
**Connection (live):**
```
Server=your-server.database.windows.net;
Database=dbAmazonCustomOrders;
UID=automation_user; PWD=your_password;
TrustServerCertificate=yes;
```

### tblCustomOrder — Key Columns
| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| idCustomOrder | uniqueidentifier PK | Primary key |
| OrderID | nvarchar | Amazon order ID e.g. 205-6487629-5805162 |
| SKU | nvarchar | Encodes colour+size e.g. MenTee_BlkM |
| Quantity | int | Number of copies ordered |
| ItemType | nvarchar | Product type (DTF etc.) |
| IsShipped | bit | Whether shipped — **the automation queue now excludes any order where this is 1, regardless of processing status** (see section 21) |
| ConvertedShipByDate | datetime | Ship-by deadline — **the Output folder is dated by this, not by processing date** (see section 6) |
| Notes | nvarchar | Used for automation error messages |

### tblCustomOrderDetails — Key Columns
| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| idCustomOrderDetails | uniqueidentifier PK | Primary key |
| idCustomOrder | uniqueidentifier FK | Links to tblCustomOrder |
| PrintLocation | nvarchar | e.g. "Front + Back + Sleeve" |
| IsFrontLocation | bit | Front zone active |
| IsBackLocation | bit | Back zone active |
| IsPocketLocation | bit | Pocket zone active |
| IsSleeveLocation | bit | Sleeve zone active |
| FrontImage | nvarchar(500) | URL/filename of customer uploaded image |
| FrontImageJSON | nvarchar | `{"Image1":"...","Image2":"..."}` — multi-image zones (e.g. pocket left+right) use this, not FrontImage |
| FrontText | nvarchar(1000) | Customer text (newline separated) |
| FrontTextJSON | nvarchar | `{"Text1":"...","Text2":"..."}` — used for semi-custom jersey name/number |
| FrontFonts | nvarchar(200) | JSON `{"NormalFont":"...","PremiumFont":"..."}` (pocket uses `{"Left Font":..,"Right Font":..}` instead) |
| FrontColours | nvarchar(200) | JSON `{"Colour1":"#hex"}` (pocket uses `{"Left Colour":..,"Right Colour":..}`) |
| FrontPreviewImage | nvarchar(500) | Amazon preview image URL — **confirmed populated** on real orders checked this session (resolves the "Questions Still Open" item from the old doc) |
| FrontTopazImage | nvarchar | JSON `{"Image1":"...-Topaz.jpg"}` — Topaz-upscaled image, produced by an **external** process, not by this script (see section 10) |
| IsTopazImageProcess | bit | Whether Topaz upscaling has completed for this row |
| CustomizationCategory | nvarchar | `Fullycustomized` (standard pipeline) or `Semicustomized` (jersey template pipeline) |
| Topaz_Processed | bit | **This is the actual "is this order done" flag the daemon checks** — not IsDesignComplete |
| ProcessBy | nvarchar | Name of whoever last touched the order on the order page (human designer name, e.g. "Ajay") **or** `AutomationScript`. A human name here does NOT mean the automation output exists — it just means someone opened the order page. |
| (same Text/Image/Fonts/Colours columns for Back, Pocket, Sleeve) | | |

### New Columns — still NOT added on this local DB (verified this session)
```sql
USE dbAmazonCustomOrders;
ALTER TABLE tblCustomOrderDetails ADD
    IsFrontBgRemove  bit NULL DEFAULT 0,
    IsBackBgRemove   bit NULL DEFAULT 0,
    IsPocketBgRemove bit NULL DEFAULT 0,
    IsSleeveBgRemove bit NULL DEFAULT 0,
    QCStatus         nvarchar(20)  NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    QCNotes          nvarchar(500) NULL,
    IsComplexOrder   bit           NULL DEFAULT 0,
    OutputFilePath   nvarchar(500) NULL;
```
None of these 8 columns currently exist on the local DB, and **none of the code that would use them (QC scoring, complexity flags) is actually implemented yet either** — see sections 11 and 14. This is still a real gap, not just a missing column.

---

## 4. Print Specifications

**Resolution: 320 DPI (dots per inch) = ~125.98 pixels/centimetre.**
The formula is **cm × 125.98 = px** (i.e. `px = cm * (320 / 2.54)`), confirmed
directly from the running code (`PX_PER_CM = DPI / 2.54`, `DPI = 320`) and
matches every real template file's actual pixel dimensions on disk.

> ⚠️ Earlier versions of this doc said "320 pixels/centimetre = 812.8 DPI" and
> listed canvas sizes computed as `cm × 320`. That was wrong — it silently
> describes a canvas **2.54× larger** than what the code actually produces.
> The cm figures below are correct (they match designer/print intent); only
> the px column and the conversion formula were fixed.

**Colour mode:** CMYK
**ICC Profile:** U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2
**Background:** Always transparent
**Format:** PSD with layers (printing team flattens before printing)
**Large files:** Auto-save as PSB if file exceeds 2GB

### Canvas Sizes — verified directly from `PRODUCT_CANVAS` in `batch_processor.py`
| Product key | Zone | Width cm | Height cm | Width px | Height px |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adulttshirt | front | 30 | 30 | 3780 | 3780 |
| adulttshirt | back | 30 | 30 | 3780 | 3780 |
| adulttshirt | pocket | 9 | 9 | 1134 | 1134 |
| kidstshirt | front | 23 | 30 | 2898 | 3780 |
| kidstshirt | back | 23 | 30 | 2898 | 3780 |
| kidstshirt | pocket | 9 | 9 | 1134 | 1134 |
| adulthoodie | front | 25 | 25 | 3150 | 3150 |
| adulthoodie | back | 25 | 25 | 3150 | 3150 |

| kidshoodie | back | 23 | 20 | 2898 | 2520 |
| kidshoodie | pocket | 9 | 9 | 1134 | 1134 |
| totebag | front | 28 | 28 | 3528 | 3528 |
| totebag | back | 28 | 28 | 3528 | 3528 |
| backpack | front | 18 | 12 | 2268 | 1512 |
| makeupbag | front | 23 | 14 | 2898 | 1764 |
| shoebag | front | 23 | 14 | 2898 | 1764 |
| shoebag2 | front | 14 | 14 | 1764 | 1764 |

| buckethat | front | 11 | 4 | 1386 | 504 |
| beanie | front | 9.5 | 4.5 | 1197 | 567 |
| socks | front | 6 | 6 | 756 | 756 |
| footballshorts | front | 6 | 9 | 756 | 1134 |
| seatbelt | front | 18 | 4 | 2268 | 504 |
| babyvest | front | 15 | 17 | 1890 | 2142 |
| sleepsuit | front | 13 | 18 | 1638 | 2268 |
| hodieblanket | front | 17 | 5 | 2142 | 630 |
| cushion | front | 30 | 30 | 3780 | 3780 |
| memorialplaque | front | 13 | 8 | 1638 | 1008 |
| golftowel | front | 17 | 17 | 2142 | 2142 |
| golfcase | front | 15 | 6 | 1890 | 756 |
| slipper | front | 6 | 6 | 756 | 756 |
| default | front | 30 | 30 | 3780 | 3780 |
| default | back | 30 | 30 | 3780 | 3780 |
| default | pocket | 9 | 9 | 1134 | 1134 |

Note vs. old doc: pocket zones are now **9×9cm square** on every product (was
documented as 9×7cm), and socks is **6×6cm** (was documented as 6×12cm).
These are the values the live code actually uses today.

Any SKU whose product can't be detected falls back to `default` — it is
**never** a hard failure (see section 8).

## 5. Amazon Print Location Combos

| Combo | Zones | Price |
|---|---|---|
| Front Pocket ONLY | pocket | base |
| Front ONLY | front | +INR 245.67 |
| Back ONLY | back | +INR 245.67 |
| Front + Back | front, back | +INR 491.34 |
| Front Pocket + Back | pocket, back | +INR 491.34 |
| Front + Sleeve | front, sleeve | +INR 368.51 |
| Front + Back + Sleeve | front, back, sleeve | +INR 614.18 |
| Front Pocket Left + Right (+ Back) | pocket_left, pocket_right, back | — |

The last row is a real, common combo (two separate images side by side in
the pocket zone). It's built as two independent zone entries
(`pocket_left`/`pocket_right`), not one — see section 7.

---

## 6. File Storage & Output Folders

**Production sync target (as originally documented — not verified this
session):** Z:\Drive DTF Orders\1. Amazon DTF\, synced India ↔ UK Synology
via SpeedFusion/Peplink.

**Local/actual base path used by the script:** `C:\gimpTest\Output\`
(`VARSANY_OUTPUT` env var, defaults to `{VARSANY_BASE}\Output`).

### The date folder is the order's SHIP-BY date, not the processing date
```python
_ship = first_row.get("ConvertedShipByDate")
_date_str = str(_ship)[:10] if _ship else datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
out_dir = os.path.join(OUTPUT_FOLDER, _date_str)
```
This surprised us mid-session: an order processed today can land in
*yesterday's* (or several days ago's) output folder if that's when it was
supposed to ship. It's correct/intentional, not a bug — but it means
"today's output folder" is not the same thing as "orders processed today."

### Actual folder structure under each date
```
Output\<ship-by-date>\
├── Automated\                    Multi-zone orders (front+back, etc.)
├── DTF Front\                    Single-zone orders
│   ├── black\                    SKU colour code contains "blk"
│   └── white\                    SKU colour code contains "wht"
├── DTF Kids Hoodie\               Kids hoodie SKUs (kidshoo/gymhoodie/kidshood)
│   ├── black\
│   └── white\
└── semicustomized\               Jersey/semi-custom orders
```
Only "black"/"white" get a colour sub-folder; every other colour saves
directly into the category folder. Filename is `{OrderID}.psd`, or
`{OrderID}_{N}items.psd` for multi-item orders.

---

## 7. Design Rules (from designer)

### Background Removal Rule
Remove background when background colour matches garment colour — see the
actual hybrid decision logic in section 13 (this section previously said
"rembg" was the mechanism; it's more nuanced than that).

### Font Sizing
- Auto-fit: largest font where all text lines fit within canvas width and height
- Short text (e.g. "I Love AI") → ~217pt
- Long text → smaller, still fills canvas nicely

### Text Line Breaks
- Customer types line breaks on Amazon → stored as \n in database
- Parse: `text.split("\n")`

### Zone Labels
Small black text above each zone on every PSD:
- "front", "back", "sleeve", "pocket", "pocket left", "pocket right"
- Front zone sometimes uses SKU code e.g. "Ylw34" (Yellow size 3-4)
- Format: `{Zone} - {Colour} {Size}` e.g. "Pocket Left - Royal Blue XL"

### Quantity > 1
Stack copies vertically on one canvas, with a 1cm gap between copies (for
cutting). Socks always print 2 copies per ordered pair, regardless of the
DB quantity value (one pair = two socks).

### Pocket "Left + Right" combo (fixed this session — see section 21)
When a pocket zone has 2 images (`PocketImageJSON` has `Image1` and
`Image2`), it is built as **two separate zones** (`pocket_left`,
`pocket_right`), each with its own image, font, and colour — pulled from
the `Left`/`Right`-prefixed keys in `PocketFonts`/`PocketColours`. A single
dict key can't hold two images, which is why this needs two zone entries
instead of one.

### Photo Collage (multiple images, front zone)
- 1 image → full canvas, 2 → side by side, 4 → 2×2, 6 → 2×3 grid
- Text (if any) goes below collage

### Screenshot Border Removal
Some customers upload screenshots with black letterbox borders.
Detect: scan edges, if 85%+ pixels are dark → auto-crop borders.

### Amazon Position Data
Amazon does NOT share X/Y coordinates of where customer dragged elements.
Only the preview image (FrontPreviewImage) shows the correct position —
**confirmed populated** on real orders (resolves an old open question).

---

## 8. PSD Templates — MAJOR CHANGE this session

**Standard ("Fullycustomized") orders no longer use template files at all.**
The UXP plugin creates a blank CMYK/transparent canvas from scratch at the
exact product/zone size (`app.documents.add(...)`), sized from the same
`PRODUCT_CANVAS` dimensions in section 4. This was a deliberate fix (see
section 21) — it eliminates the entire class of "No template found for
X/default" failures that used to happen for any unmapped SKU or product.

**Only semi-custom (jersey) orders still open a real template file.** These
templates contain pre-built named layers (crest artwork, `Player`/`08` text
placeholders) that can't be generated from a blank canvas.

### Semi-custom slot config (`SEMI_CUSTOM_SLOT_CONFIG` in batch_processor.py)
| Template file | Slots | Slot height | Text layers |
|---|---|---|---|
| england Football Adult.psd | 7 | 3780px | `Player`, `08` (+ Photoshop auto-copy names for slots 2-7) |
| england Football Kids.psd | 7 | 3780px | same |
| scotland Football Adult.psd | 7 | 3780px | same |
| scotland Football Kids.psd | 7 | 3780px | same |

⚠️ **Only `england Football Adult.psd` currently exists in `C:\gimpTest\template\`.**
The other 3 configured templates are missing on this machine — any
Scotland or Kids jersey order will fail until those files are restored.

The `template\` folder also still contains ~25 other `{product}.psd` /
`{product}_combined.psd` files (adulttshirt.psd, babyvest.psd, etc.) —
**these are now orphaned/unused** by the standard pipeline since the
canvas-creation change above. They can be archived or deleted; nothing
reads them anymore for non-jersey orders.

---

## 9. Fonts

- Database fonts field is JSON: `{"NormalFont":"...","PremiumFont":"..."}` for
  front/back, `{"Left Font":..,"Right Font":..,"PremiumFont":..}` for pocket.
- When `PremiumFont` is set and resolves to a known font: colour is ignored,
  font has built-in texture (camo, glitter, SVG colour fonts etc.)
- **Fonts are scanned from 4 locations** (`FONT_FOLDERS` in batch_processor.py),
  not just one folder:
  1. `{VARSANY_BASE}\Fonts` (project-local, travels with the repo folder)
  2. `VARSANY_FONTS_EXTRA` — comma-separated extra folders (`.env`-configured;
     on this machine: `C:\gimpTest\Fonts\Premium Fonts`, `C:\gimpTest\Fonts\Fonts`)
  3. `C:\Windows\Fonts` (OS-wide, hardcoded path)
  4. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts` (per-user, hardcoded path) —
     **this one is the migration risk**: it's outside the project folder,
     outside git, and tied to this specific Windows user profile. Many key
     premium/SVG-colour fonts (Camoblock, Wavemermaid, Soccer Army, etc.)
     live only here. A consolidated copy of all 4 sources (688 unique fonts,
     verified complete) exists at `C:\Users\VARHeist\Desktop\fonts` for
     migration to a new server.
- **Not every font name in the DB is a real font.** `FONT_ALIASES` deliberately
  maps some normalized names to `None` — these are category/decoration labels
  customers pick from a dropdown (`Rhinestone`, `Embroidery Font`, `DTF Text`,
  `Varsany`, etc.), not typefaces. They're intentionally never resolved to a
  file; they're used instead to detect and skip non-DTF orders (see section 10).
- If a real font name has no file and no alias → font lookup silently fails.
  14 such gaps were found this session (some genuine missing fonts like
  `Abril Fatface`/`Cookie`/`Great Vibes`, some likely mislabeled non-fonts
  like `Football Shorts`/`T-Shirt Font` that just need a `None` alias added).

---

## 10. Automation Pipeline

**Script:** `batch_processor.py`
**Language:** Python 3.14
**Runs as:** a Windows Service (`VarsanyDaemon`, via NSSM at `C:\nssm\nssm.exe`)
— **not** just a manually-run script. This means:
- It survives closing any terminal/RDP session, and restarts automatically
  if it crashes (`nssm set VarsanyDaemon AppParameters ...` to change its
  launch args — editing `start_daemon.bat` alone does **not** change what
  the service actually runs, since the service has its own stored config).
- Queue "resuming" after a restart is automatic and safe — the queue is a
  live DB query (`Topaz_Processed = 0/NULL AND IsShipped = 0/NULL`), not an
  in-memory position, so nothing gets skipped or duplicated on restart.
**Poll interval:** every 30 seconds

### Processing engine: Photoshop UXP plugin, not GIMP
Earlier versions of this doc described a GIMP-headless pipeline. **That was
never actually built** — there is zero GIMP code anywhere in this repo. The
real pipeline is: Python (`batch_processor.py`) → `ps_bridge.py` writes a
job JSON to `jobs\` → the UXP plugin (`uxp-plugin\index.html`, running
inside a real, open Photoshop) picks it up, builds the PSD via
`batchPlay`/DOM API calls, and writes a done/error marker back. See
section 12 for the actual mechanism.

### Processing Steps Per Order (as actually implemented)
1. `fetch_orders()` reads pending rows: `Topaz_Processed = 0/NULL AND IsShipped = 0/NULL`, ordered by `DateAdd ASC`
2. Detect embroidery/rhinestone SKUs or font labels → skip (never marked processed — see section 19 for why this matters for queue counts)
3. Detect semi-custom (jersey) vs standard via `CustomizationCategory` + a matching template
4. For each active zone: resolve image (Topaz-upscaled version preferred — **Topaz upscaling itself happens in a separate, external process/service, not in this script**; this script just waits for `IsTopazImageProcess=1` and reads the resulting URL), resolve font/colour, apply background removal if needed
5. Submit a job to the UXP plugin (dynamic blank canvas for standard orders, real template for semi-custom)
6. UXP builds layers, saves the PSD, reports done/error
7. On success: mark `Topaz_Processed = 1` on every detail row for that order
8. On failure: log and leave the order pending for the next poll cycle (no DB flag change)

**Not implemented (still just documented intent, no code exists for these):**
- Complexity flagging (section 11)
- QC thumbnail/confidence scoring (section 14)
- Slack/email alerts of any kind

---

## 11. Complexity Flags — ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED

This table describes a **planned** system. No code anywhere in
`batch_processor.py` currently writes any of these flag values or an
`IsComplexOrder`/`QCStatus` column (those columns don't exist yet either —
section 3). Treat this as a design doc for future work, not current behavior.

| Code | Reason |
|---|---|
| screenshot_border | Black letterbox borders detected |
| low_resolution | Image < 500px even after upscaling |
| bg_removal_uncertain | Confidence < 80% |
| too_many_photos | More than 6 photos in collage |
| text_overflow | Text too long for canvas |
| unknown_product | Product not in PRODUCT_CANVAS (in practice: falls back to `default`, doesn't fail — see section 8) |
| processing_error | Any script error |
| premium_font | Font .ttf file not installed |

---

## 12. Layered PSD Generation (actual mechanism)

**Engine:** Adobe Photoshop, driven via the **UXP plugin API**
(`uxp-plugin/index.js`, loaded by `index.html`), not GIMP.

> ⚠️ **All plugin JS lives in `index.js`, loaded via `<script src="index.js">`
> — it must NOT be inlined back into `index.html`.** UXP has a documented,
> version-inconsistent restriction that refuses to execute JS embedded
> directly in a `<script>` block in the HTML ("Refusing to load inline
> script tag as executable code. Code generation is disabled in plugins.").
> This surfaced during migration to a new server running an older Photoshop
> build (v27.4.0) — the same inline-script setup happened to work on this
> server's v27.8.0, but was never actually safe. The manifest's
> `allowCodeGenerationFromStrings` permission does **not** cover this — that
> only governs inline HTML event-handler attributes (`onclick="..."`), a
> different restriction entirely.

- Python (`ps_bridge.py`) writes a job JSON to `C:\gimpTest\jobs\{OrderID}.json`
  containing zone data (image paths, text, font, colour, canvas size) and
  polls `done\`/`error\` for a matching marker file.
- The UXP plugin polls `jobs\` every few seconds, and processes each job
  inside `core.executeAsModal(...)`, using `action.batchPlay([...])`
  descriptors for every layer operation (make layer, place image, set text,
  align, rasterize, resize canvas, save).
- **Standard orders:** canvas is created fresh via `app.documents.add({width, height, resolution:320, mode:CMYK, fill:TRANSPARENT, profile:"U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2"})`. No template file opened.
- **Semi-custom orders:** the real template `.psd` is opened, and named text
  layers (`Player`, `08`, and their Photoshop auto-copy names for extra
  slots) are edited in place via `batchPlay`'s `set textLayer` descriptor.

**Layer naming actually produced** (verified by opening real output files
with `psd-tools` this session):
- `Label_{Zone} - {Colour} {Size}` — the black zone-identifier text
- `Preview_{zone}_{index}` — hidden Amazon preview image, kept for reference
- `{raw image filename}` (e.g. `65236222312682-1-pocket-Topaz`) — the customer image, placed and rasterized
- `Text_{zone}_{timestamp}` — rendered customer text
- Semi-custom: `Player`/`08` and their `... copy N` variants (text), plus
  supporting graphic/Smart Object layers per slot (not name-distinguished
  per slot — same name can repeat across slots)

**Known performance issue (not yet fixed, root-caused this session):** this
machine has no real GPU (`Microsoft Hyper-V Video` / `Microsoft Remote
Display Adapter` only), so large-canvas compositing is fully CPU-bound. The
UXP code also currently uses many single-descriptor `batchPlay` calls,
`synchronousExecution:true` (Adobe's own docs say to avoid this), and no
`suspendHistory`/`resumeHistory` wrapping — meaning Photoshop likely
snapshots the whole canvas for undo after nearly every micro-operation.
This is believed to be the biggest lever for speeding up processing; see the
session notes for the specific code changes identified but not yet applied.

**No PNG-per-layer fallback exists** — if UXP/Photoshop is unavailable, the
order simply fails and stays in the queue; there's no degraded-mode output.

---

## 13. Background Removal (actual hybrid logic — not just rembg)

**Decision logic (in order, first match wins):**
1. Manual flag / `--force-bg-remove` CLI flag — highest priority
2. Auto-detection: does the image's background colour match the garment's
   colour (from a SKU→RGB colour map)?
3. If removal is triggered:
   - **Dark garments (black, navy, etc.) → always colour-key removal.**
     rembg (AI background removal) is deliberately **not** used here — it
     destroys dark graphic designs. Colour-key is precise for flat/graphic
     images.
   - **Light garments → rembg first**, with a validation check: if rembg's
     output leaves fewer than 15% of pixels visible (a sign it mis-detected
     a flat graphic as "background"), it automatically falls back to
     colour-key removal instead.

**SKU colour map** (approximate garment RGB, used for the colour-match check):
```python
colour_map = {
    "blk": (20, 20, 20),
    "wht": (255, 255, 255),
    "nvy": (31, 40, 80),
    "red": (200, 30, 30),
    "ylw": (255, 220, 0),
    "pnk": (255, 150, 180),
    "gry": (150, 150, 150),
}
```

---

## 14. QC System — ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED

Same status as section 11 — this is a design doc, not current behavior. No
thumbnail generation, confidence scoring, or alerting code exists yet.

1. *(planned)* Script generates PNG thumbnail of output
2. *(planned)* Compares to FrontPreviewImage (Amazon reference)
3. *(planned)* Confidence score 0-100%
4. *(planned)* ≥85% → auto-move to print folder
5. *(planned)* <85% → alert design team

**Not in this repo (`.gitignore` excludes them):** `Output\`, `Temp\`,
`done\`, `error\`, `Fonts\`, `template\`, `.env`, all `.psd`/`.psb`/`.log`
files. A `git clone` alone will **not** produce a working setup — see the
migration notes in section 19.

## 17. Developer Tasks Pending

1. Add 8 new columns to tblCustomOrderDetails (SQL in section 3) — confirmed still not done on local DB
2. Add "Remove Background: Yes/No" dropdown on order page for each zone
3. Create automation_user SQL login (SELECT + UPDATE only)
4. Open firewall port 1433 for automation PC IP
5. ~~Confirm whether FrontPreviewImage is populated on live database~~ — **RESOLVED: yes, confirmed populated on real orders checked this session**
6. Video call with Dhruv to reorganise Synology folder structure
7. *(new)* Restore the 3 missing semi-custom jersey templates (Kids/Scotland variants — section 8)
8. *(new)* Investigate the "UXP reported done but output file missing" failure mode — hit at least twice this session on standard multi-item orders, distinct from the (already-fixed) semi-custom timeout issue
9. *(new)* Implement the UXP performance fixes identified this session (suspendHistory, batched batchPlay calls) if queue growth continues to outpace throughput

## 19. Important Technical Notes

- **72 PPI display issue:** Photoshop shows 72ppi when opening output but
  pixel dimensions are correct — this is display metadata only
- **File naming:** `{OrderID}.psd`, or `{OrderID}_{N}items.psd` for multi-item orders
- **PSB:** Auto-triggered when estimated size >2GB
- **The daemon and Photoshop/UXP are decoupled, asynchronous processes.**
  Restarting the Python daemon does **not** cancel a job UXP is already
  working on — it keeps rendering in the background at its own pace. A
  large multi-item job can finish minutes or hours after Python gave up
  waiting on it and moved on. This caused confusion this session when an
  already-shipped order's PSD kept getting saved well after the order was
  supposedly excluded from the queue — the job had been submitted before
  the exclusion filter existed, and UXP was still grinding through it.
- **"Skipped" ≠ "processed."** Orders detected as embroidery/rhinestone are
  logged as skipped every single poll cycle **forever** — skipping never
  sets `Topaz_Processed`, so they permanently inflate the "pending" count
  unless someone processes them manually and updates the DB.
- **Wrong template:** was a daily problem for the printing team under the
  old manual process — no longer applicable now that standard orders don't
  use template files at all (section 8).
- **Server migration:** the font-scanning mechanism itself needs no code
  changes to move servers (it's `.env`-driven) — but 2 of its 4 source
  folders (`C:\Windows\Fonts`, the per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%` folder) are
  machine-specific and won't come along with a `git clone`. A consolidated,
  verified-complete copy of all currently-used fonts exists at
  `C:\Users\VARHeist\Desktop\fonts` for this purpose.
- **Antigravity:** Uses Google account login only —
  Yedhu@fullymerched.com (Microsoft) won't work — use personal Gmail

## 20. Questions Still Open

1. ~~Exact 28 PSD template filenames~~ — largely moot now; standard orders don't use template files at all (section 8). Still open: recovering the 3 missing semi-custom jersey templates.
2. ~~Is FrontPreviewImage populated on live database?~~ — **RESOLVED, yes.**
3. What layer names are inside the semi-custom jersey templates beyond `Player`/`08` (the decorative/crest Smart Object layers aren't uniquely named per slot, which matters if we ever want to programmatically delete unused-slot layers)?
4. Video call with Dhruv re: Synology folder structure
5. Font files list — **RESOLVED for this machine**, see section 9; still need the equivalent audit on the designer's own PC if fonts differ there
6. Does printing team prefer all-in-one file or separate per zone for quantity orders? (Current behavior: all-in-one, stacked vertically)
7. *(new)* Why do some standard multi-item orders fail with "output file missing" despite UXP reporting done? (section 17, item 8)

## 21. Session Changelog (2026-07-16 verification pass)

Fixes actually implemented and verified working in `batch_processor.py` /
`uxp-plugin/index.html` this session, in case future work builds on
assumptions from before these existed:

- Standard orders build their canvas dynamically in UXP instead of opening
  a template file (section 8) — eliminated a whole class of "No template
  found" failures.
- Golf towel SKU prefix (`AnyTxtTwl_`) was falling through to the generic
  `AnyTxt→adulttshirt` catch-all and getting the wrong canvas size — fixed
  in `SKU_MAP`.
- Pocket "left + right" 2-image combo now correctly splits into two zones
  with per-side font/colour resolution (was silently dropping the second
  image and using the wrong colour for both sides).
- Semi-custom Photoshop timeout raised from `120s × item count` to
  `max(600, 150 × item count)` — large jersey templates were genuinely
  taking longer than the old timeout, causing false "FAILED" results and
  duplicate output files on retry.
- Orders already marked `IsShipped=1` are now excluded from the processing
  queue entirely — this turned out to be the majority of the backlog (614
  → 45 unique orders in one before/after check).
- The daemon runs as a Windows Service (`VarsanyDaemon`, NSSM) — this was
  discovered mid-session (editing `start_daemon.bat` alone doesn't change
  what the live service runs; its `AppParameters` must be updated directly).
- **Migration finding:** `install_fonts.py` was pointing at a dead `A:\font\`
  drive and a ~20-font hardcoded subset from an earlier server setup —
  rewritten to install every font from any `--source` folder, matching the
  full 688-font set actually in use (see section 9).
- **Migration finding:** all of `uxp-plugin/index.html`'s JS was inline in a
  `<script>` block. This broke on a new server's older Photoshop build
  (v27.4.0) with `"Refusing to load inline script tag as executable code"`
  — a documented, version-inconsistent UXP restriction, unrelated to the
  `allowCodeGenerationFromStrings` manifest permission. Fixed by extracting
  all logic into `uxp-plugin/index.js`, loaded via `<script src="index.js">`
  (section 12) — this is the version-safe pattern and should be used for
  any future plugin changes, never inline `<script>` content again.
